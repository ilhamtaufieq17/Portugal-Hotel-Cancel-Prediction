 # Project Overview

In the hospitality industry, customer cancellations are a significant concern, impacting both revenue and operational efficiency. This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to identify patterns and predict cancellations, enabling stakeholders to mitigate the adverse effects of last-minute cancellations.

## Business Context

Frequent cancellations can leave hotels with unoccupied rooms, directly leading to revenue losses and operational inefficiencies. These cancellations may force hotels to overbook as a countermeasure, which can further degrade customer satisfaction and damage the hotel's reputation. This project aims to provide actionable insights to improve booking strategies and enhance overall resource management.

## Problem Statement

Stakeholders
Hotel Management: Oversees hotel operations and revenue management, relying on data-driven strategies to improve booking efficiency.
Marketing Team: Develops targeted marketing campaigns to attract the right customers, using insights from booking and cancellation patterns.
Revenue Management Team: Maximizes profitability by analyzing booking trends, cancellations, and pricing strategies.
Challenges
The primary challenge is the unpredictability of cancellations, which hampers efficient resource allocation and can lead to revenue loss. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict cancellations, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions that minimize negative impacts on the hotelâ€™s operations and profitability.
